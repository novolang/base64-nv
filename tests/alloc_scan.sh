#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/alloc_scan.sh — nothing in `base64_core` allocates, as a check
# that can fail.
#
# `base64_core` is the half a device runs.  What makes it usable there
# is not that it avoids `Bytes`, which the type checker decides, but
# that it puts nothing on the heap.  Nothing in the language enforces
# that, and the emitted LLVM is where it is true or false, so this
# reads it.
#
# There are three runs, because a check that cannot fail is not a check.
#
#   1. Every function in `base64_core` appears in the IR of
#      `tests/alloc_probe.nv` at `--opt=0`, and none of them calls the
#      allocator, directly or through a runtime entry point that
#      allocates on the caller's behalf.
#   2. The scan still sees an allocation.  A heap list literal is
#      spliced into `symbol` on a copy of the tree, with that function's
#      `@tier(embedded)` taken off so the compiler is not what refuses
#      it, and the scan has to name it.  Without this run, a scan that
#      quietly stopped matching would pass forever.
#   3. The compiler still refuses the same splice with
#      `@tier(embedded)` left on.  An annotation that stopped being
#      enforced looks exactly like one that passes.
#
# Run from anywhere:  bash tests/alloc_scan.sh
